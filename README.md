<!-- Instructions -->
One of the beauties of a classic RPG is that you're tossed into a world with plenty to learn. I feel like one of the travesties of modern rpg's is that the tutorials are forced and leave no mystery/ruin the learning experience. 

<!-- Approach -->
I personally like to start with creating something visually and then adding function where it's necessary. Starting with my background and two players and then adding where interactions will be. After the UI is placed I was able to add function to each button one at a time making sure they worked along the way until everything served a purpose- even if unfinished (inventory).

<!-- Unsolved Issues -->
Being able to make the damage numbers run an animation on attack function. Currently coded out, it will work on the first time the function is run but won't continue for the same enemy.
